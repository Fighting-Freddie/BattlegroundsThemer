Creating your own themes:


Standard theme file structure:
	index.html
	scripts.js
	stylesheet.css

	index.html
		This file contains your HTML code for your main menu theme
		
	scripts.js
		This file should contain any Javascript you want to be executed immediatly.
		Inline scripts inside index.html will work perfectly, however they may only
		execute when the DOM is fully loaded.
		
	stylesheet.css
		Similarly to scripts.js, a stylesheet with this name will be injected
		immediatly.

	

Standard theme element ID's and classes:
	IDs:
	  battlegroundsThemer_body
	  battlegroundsThemer_play
	  battlegroundsThemer_username
	  battlegroundsThemer_battlepoints
	  battlegroundsThemer_version
	  battlegroundsThemer_logo
	  battlegroundsThemer_home
	  battlegroundsThemer_character
	  battlegroundsThemer_rewards
	  battlegroundsThemer_stats
	  battlegroundsThemer_leaderboard
	  battlegroundsThemer_notification
	  battlegroundsThemer_friendsRefresh
	  battlegroundsThemer_friendsPlayingCount
	  battlegroundsThemer_friendsOnlineCount
	  battlegroundsThemer_recieveInvites
	
	Classes:
	  battlegroundsThemer_invite
	  battlegroundsThemer_stats
	
	Use these IDs on your elements to make your theme interactive. For examples,
	read the html file for the default themes.
	
	If you add one of these attributes to your theme, the original corrisponding UI
	will be hidden automatically from the main menu for yours to take its place.
	


Referencing extra files within your theme:
	To reference extra files (pictures, fonts, scripts etc) you've added to your
	theme folder you must use the 'battlegroundsThemer_ROOT' keyword for them to
	work in-game.
	
	For example, if I add a picture file named "battlepoints.png" to my theme's folder,
	when putting this in an image element I would use the following code:
	<img src="battlegroundsThemer_ROOT/battlepoints.png" />


	
Making your menu interactive:
	You must manually add "pointer-events: auto" to theme elements that you want to be
	Clickable/hoverable or the events will be passed through to the existing main menu!
	An easy way to do this is to add this to the top of your CSS stylesheet:
	#battlegroundsThemer_body > * {pointer-events: auto}

	
	
Tips:
  - Try to avoid using any external sources for content like scripts, styles,
	images and fonts. Storing these files within your theme folder and then linking
	directly to them will reduce load times and avoid your theme being dependant on
	external websites.
	
	
  - Don't include spaces in your references to files in the URLs. For example, this
	is incorrect:
	url('battlegroundsThemer_ROOT/Roboto Condensed/Condensed.ttf')
	
	But this example will work:
	url('battlegroundsThemer_ROOT/RobotoCondensed/Condensed.ttf')
	
	
  - Your CSS should be made so that the UI scales with the screen size. It should
	scale to the size of the smallest window axis. To do this, instead of using px
	with CSS use the unit vmin.
	
	Explanation of viewport units:
	  1vw = 1/100th viewport width
	  1vh = 1/100th viewport height
	  1vmin = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is smaller

	  
  - Battlegrounds doesn't support the CSS 'filter' property! Use '-webkit-filter' instead.
  
	
  - CSS border radius editing doesn't seem to be supported at all.
  
  - battlegroundsThemer_recieveInvites must be an <input> element with the type set to
	'checkbox' or the theme injector will not be able to update its state.
